        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that makes the world a better place. Heroes show compassion and try to help anyone they can. Who is considered a hero says a lot about what kind of society we live in.</p>
        <p>Since the 1990's Tia Torres has devoted her life to rescueing animals and people. She belives in second chances to those who need it most, whether it's animals or people. She has shown the world how much second chances mean to anmials and people by starting a pitbull rescue that only hirees parolees. Since she opened up her rescue center she has sacrifised everything to make sure that pitbulls won't be abused and help parolees from going back to prison by giving them a job and opportunity .</p>
